his closing interview with the Patriarch Heraclius; his
tears at the burning of Le Maus, the suspicions enter-
tained by Richard of his father’s intention to disinherit
him in favour of John; the sad account of the last sick-
ness os the King. These constitute the most amusing
portion of the work, and, if faithfully narrated, the most
important, as given on the authority of one who was
present at the time.

Of the different forms in which anecdotes appear in
his account may be mentioned that of Philip Augustus
throwing himself for sorrow into Geoffrey’s grave3 the
dream of the Prior of Dunstable, with the waming given
to William II.; the last interview between Louis and
the King of England.

Το these circumstances, which give the work no slight
value and interest, we may add the fact of its being
the author’s matured production, begun with his earliest,
and finished with the last. To this work he refers more
frequently than to any other of his numerous writings,
as one on which he had bestowed the greatest pains,
and used the utmost care in ascertaining the truth severely.
Thus in one of his latest productioris he says of it :-
“Dialoyos autem praesens, una eum libello de Principis
“ Institutione toties promisso, diu nimirum valde diligenter
“ atque latenter hyemalibus lucubrationibus crebriS, juxta
“veritatem historicam, et quae veris parcere non novit
“severitatem elaborato, ideoque tam sero prodire in
‘⁴ publicum et proferre caput denique ,vix auso, tanquam

“anno aetatis meae septuagesimo.”-De Jure Menev.
Ecol. p. 627. Again, in his Epistle to the Chapter
ol Hereford: “Post monita vero suscepta, grata plurimum
“ et accepta, maturioribus studiis atque majoribus animum
