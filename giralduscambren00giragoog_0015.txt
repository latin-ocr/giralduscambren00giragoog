Χ PREFAOE.

“ applicando, librum de Principis Instructam, multis auc-
“toritatibus tam philosophicis quam theologicis, per ex-
“ empla pariter et praecepta, studioso labore compagina-
“ tum, longisque lucubrationibus elaboratum edere curavi.”
-p. 442.

To these passages one other shall be added, as reference
will be made to it hereafter: “Liber de Principis
“Instructioaa toties promissus, fere inter primos inchoa-
“ tus, inter ultimos autem propalatus, diu nimium
“clausus et sopitus, quando tute prodire posset plurimis
‘⁴ annorum curriculis tempus expectans, liberaliter quidem
“ et non livide legenti labor sua quoque laude non indig-
“ nus.'’-Catalogus brevior librorum suorum, p. 446.

An author like Giraldus, whose life had been chequered
by such varied soenes, who had frequently visited Paris
and Rome, had studied for years in both cities, had been
employed in negotiations of the most delicate nature,
and enjoyed the most intimate acquaintance with contempo-
rary statesmen and prelates, in penning a work like the
present, and reviewing the soenes of his past life, could
scarcely fail of committing to paper events and anecdotos
interesting to the general mador, and most important to
the scholar employed in historical investigatione.

Itis then no matter of surprise, that the publication

of the work' should have been anxiously expected

by persons fully competent to judge of its merits,¹
or that the Editors of the French Historical Collec-
tion should have sofar departed from their plan, as to
insert in their great work more copious abstracte from it.
Before closing this preface, it will be proper to allude

¹ Sec Wharton in his preface to the Anglia Sacra, and Mr. Wright
in his AngloNorman Biography.
