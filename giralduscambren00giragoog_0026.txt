Thus far, but no further than this, was Giraldus a
political opponent to Henry Il. and his successors3 aud
no further than this (as it seems to me) are we warranted
in drawing the conclusione of Bouquet and his Editors.

It has been already stated, that no copy of the first
edition of this work is now known to exist. Unfor-
tunately the remark may be further extended; for no
other MS. can be found than the one now preserved in
the Cotton Library, and from which the work is now
for the first time printed almost entire. I say almost
entire, because the term applies strictly to the second
aud third books which contain a connected view of the
reign of Henry IL, and may be considered as forming
a distinct treatise. Itis for this reason that they stand
in prior order to the first book, which being for the
most part purely ethical, or as the author himself describes

it, “per praecepta docens,'’ was little suited to the pur-
poses of the Society. All such passages, however, of the

first book as were of the least historical interest, have
been placed in the Appendix.
Although this arrangement may appear in some respect

preposterous, yet it was thought to be more convenient,

and less likely to interrupt the continuity of the history3
especially as those passages of it which were deemed
worth preserving and printing, have little or no connection
with the subject of the second and third books. If, how·

· ever, the reader wishes to peruse the work in its original

order, he should begin with the Appendix, and then pro-
ceed with the second and third books in the order in
which they are printed.
