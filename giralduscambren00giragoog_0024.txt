aud especially their ecclesiastical independeuce, his whole
h'fe was spent, his hopes of promotion abandoned, his time
and his talents devoted; hopes never destined to be re-

“so much trouble to procure blessings for your people,
“which they care so little about, and make them free
“ in spite of themselves; for you see that they now
“ disown you.” “It is very true ” (said Giraldus),
“and Ι was far from expecting it. I did not think

He had no political object beyond this3 no sympathy with
the Norman prelates and barons, beyond the hope that
the struggle might bridle the power of the Norman Kings,
and give some relies to the conquered. Whatever tended

to promote this, the cherished object of his thoughts, was
