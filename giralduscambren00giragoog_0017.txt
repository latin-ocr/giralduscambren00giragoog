From the foregoing remarks it may be inserted that
the Editors 01 Bouquet’s Collection conceived that this
work of Giraldus had been composed at two different
times, and to suit two different pnrposes. They affirm
that the first book or Distinction (as it is called) wherein
the writer‘s object is to show the various duties 01 princes,
was written long before the others (longe ante alias com-
posita); and they thereupon conclude that the other two
books were published at a much later period, in the reign
01 King John, to encourage the Barons in their rebellion
against the King and his successor.

Both these assertione are important, and so intimately
connected, that one can hardly stand without the other.
There is also a strong appearance 01 probability in
them3 from the fact, that Giraldus often speaks against
the race 01 the Anjou princes in terms 01 unmeasured
reprobation. These passages are so numerous, that it
would occupy too much time to collect them here3
neither is it necessary, for the reader may see a particular
and sufficient instance iu the twenty-seventh chapter of
the third book.

Two passages, however, are remarkable, and merit a
more particular notice. At the close 01 the chapter
just quoted, after observing that all insular people are sub-

ject to be governed by ty'rants, according 10 the remark 01

Boethius,¹ Giraldus proceeds to say, that, had the dominion
01 France prospered in this country, as many desired that
